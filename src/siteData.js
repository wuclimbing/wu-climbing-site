There is no team coach; team leadership members will help new climbers get started, teaching new members how to belay and climbing basics, but the majority of teaching and learning is cooperative."

As for outdoor climbing, weekend trips are led to Jackson Falls, the Holy Boulders, Horseshoe Canyon Ranch, Perf Marquette, and more! Every year the team leads a Fall Break trip to the Bread River Gorge, and last year’s Spring Break took us to Shelf Road in Colorado!"],

Although there is no requirement for attending practices and events, it is expected that team members do so in order to participate in the community."],
